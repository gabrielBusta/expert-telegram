## Homemade Dark Chocolate

**Yield:** ~6 small bars or 12 pieces  
**Total Time:** ~30-40 minutes (plus chilling)  
**Tools Needed:** Cooking thermometer, double boiler, spatula, bowl scraper, molds or tray

### **Ingredients**
- 50g raw cocoa butter  
- 50g raw cocoa powder (sifted)  
- 3 tablespoons cane sugar, finely ground (use spice grinder or blender)  
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (water-based)  
- Pinch of sea salt (optional)

### **Instructions**

#### 1. Prep the Ingridients
- Shave or chop the cocoa butter finely (for even melting.)
- Grind the cane sugar to a fine powder (so it dissolves better.)
- Sift the cocoa powder (to remove lumps.)

#### 2. Melt and Combine
- In a double boiler (or heatproof bowl over simmering water), gently melt the cocoa butter.
- Once fully melted, stir in the ground cane sugar and vanilla extract.
- Stir continuously until mostly dissolved.
- Stir in the sifted cocoa powder and a pinch of sea salt.
- Mix well until fully smooth. You've now made your chocolate base!

#### 3. Begin Tempering
- Keep the bowl over heat until the mixture reaches **46-49C (115-120F)**
- **Stir constantly.** This ensures all unstable cocoa butter crystals melt.
- Remove from heat and let the mixture **cool down to 27-28C (80-82F)**
- **Stir constantly.** This prevent clumps and encourage stable crystals to form.
- Gently reheat the mixture back to **31-32C (88-90F)**

#### 4. Test Your Temper
- Keep the rest of the chocolate warm at **31-32C (88-90F)**
- Take a small spoonful of the chocolate and set it aside at room temperature for a few minutes.
- This is just a test sample to confirm that the chocolate is properly tempered
- If it sets within 5 minutes with a shiny finish and firm snap, it's tempered and ready to use.

#### 5. Mold and Set
- Pour the tempered chocolate into silicone molds or a parchment-lined tray.
- Tap to remove air bubbles.
- Let it set at **cool room temperature (18-21C / 65-70F)**
- If needed, chill in the fridge for a short time to fully harden.

#### 6. Store
Once solid, remove from molds and store in an airtight container at cool room temp or the fridge.
